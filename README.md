# House Price Predictor
The house price predictor is a freely available dataset that belongs to a Kaggle competion under the name "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". The main reason for implementing this dataset is to use it as a roadmap to analyze the factors associated with the pricing of a house. The following python notebook, shows a step by step basic - ground zero approach to load, clean, analyze and predict future outcomes. Analysis of the data is done such that we have a better understanding so as to which features within the dataset are useful for building a strong model.
<br>The Kaggle dataset is attached to this repository. Whereas the kaggle competion link is given below.
